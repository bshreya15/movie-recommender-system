## Showtime! - Movie Recommendation App

Welcome to **Showtime!**, a movie recommendation app that helps you discover movies similar to your favorite ones. Powered by the Movie Database (TMDb) API, this app uses a movie recommendation model to suggest movies based on the one you select.

## Features

- **Movie Selection**: Choose a movie from a list of popular movies.
- **Recommendations**: Receive recommendations for similar movies based on the selected movie.
- **Posters**: View movie posters for all recommended movies.
- **Custom Styling**: The app is styled with custom CSS for a sleek and clean interface.

## How it Works

1. **Select a Movie**: From a dropdown list, select the movie you would like recommendations for.
2. **Get Recommendations**: Once you click "Recommend", the app will find movies similar to your selected one, display their posters, and show their names.
3. **Fetch Movie Posters**: The app fetches the movie posters from the TMDb API to enhance your movie discovery experience.
